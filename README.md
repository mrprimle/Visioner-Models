# Visioner-Models

Distance model: TF object detection model. I removed all the classes except a Car and a Person. Implemented the triangular similarity algorithm for distance estimation. Used for acceleration/deceleration depending on the distance.

Steering model: Rather a Computer Vision app, then a model. Implemented lane detection using OpenCV for steering estimation. Used for wheel steering.

Straight lanes:

Each model is on-device and real-time.
